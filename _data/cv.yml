  type: list
  contents:
  - My research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning and applying my methods in order to study how machines can mimic humans in congitive tasks, especially those related to Language.
  - I am also interested in creating AI agents that can understand language and reason, therefore I have also worked on natural language processing with a focus on negotiation, persuasion, dialogue and question answering.
  - I am passionate about focusing my efforts in advancing low resource NLP and I am specifically working on multilingual summarization. 
  - I also like to think about knowledge and knowledge proliferation in our society.
